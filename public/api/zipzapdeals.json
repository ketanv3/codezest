    "Founded in 2014 by young university students, ZipZap Deals is a startup that deals in the space of providing exclusive discounts to students at hundreds of outlets around the city.",
    "At the time I joined this organisation, a complete revamp from scratch was required to incorporate the changing user requirements. I had a multitude of tasks at hand to be done within a short span of 3 months as an intern.",
    "Re-architect the entire tech-stack, set up EC2 instances and a self-hosted Parse server, develop Android apps for the users & vendors, create PWA dashboard for vendors to track sales, set-up a payment gateway, and build the website and perform SEO were some of the tasks that I did at ZipZap Deals."
