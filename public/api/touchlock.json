    "Smart physical locks that get detected by your phone when in close proximity. To unlock, simply use your fingerprint to authenticate access. That's it, no more keys needed!",
    "Well, not that straightforward. To make this possible, not only did I have to make the frontend application for the Android platform, I also built the hardware required for the physical lock itself â€“ using an Arduino and some servo motors.",
    "In the end, I had a working smart-lock that works seamlessly with Prope."
